Today was all about blender. Emily got me a subscription to SkillShare for my
birthday and I'm finally putting it to use. It's super helpful for hitting the
ground running with some of these artistic tools that I've never used before.

I'm way more productive in blender already! I'm not sure that I'm ready to jump
right in to designing the owl for the game but I am at least starting to learn
the path to achieve that.
