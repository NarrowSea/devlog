Just finished the fourth tutorial. Oliver and Emily are at a play date this
afternoon which gives me some extra NS time. There's only one more tutorial to
go and then it's back to ... what?

If I tackle my weakest point, the next step will be to go through a blender /
unity tutorial of rigging and animating a character and bringing that into the
owl. Since animations are going to be all over the place in FindTheOwl, that
makes a lot of sense to me. At least the actual wings-flapping in-flight part.

The timing of that strategy ends up working well, too. I finished my first
blender tutorial on Feb 2nd (10 days ago) so it's getting to the point where if
I don't jump back in I might start forgetting the lessons learned so far.

There are 29 days (4 weeks and 1 day) left in this work cycle. Which is getting
tight. I want to save some time in the cycle for player testing which means:

Week 1:
  - Learn how to rig skeletons to characters for use in Unity
  - Including rigging the owl's main flight animation

Week 2:
  - Bring the owl into a Unity game with:
    - (WC1#01.01.01) Controller input
    - (WC1#01.01.02) Gravity and flapping
    - (WC1#01.01.03) Left and right gliding
    - (WC1#01.01.04) Smart Camera

Week 3, 4:
  - (WC1#01.02) Animate the other owl and bring it into the game
  - (WC1#01.03) Have a three layer soundtrack that plays based on proximity
  - Polish as much as possible
  - (WC1#01.04) Play testing

Sounds reasonable except that I still have no idea how to animate at all.
Thank wumpus that I still maintain an unreasonable amount of self confidence in
my abilities to figure all of this out. Anyways, Emily is heading back now so
I have another 30m to squeeze into this session before my nighttime session.

Finished the unity tutorial series. I know that there's a lot more to learn, but
I'm feeling good about jumping back over to blender tomorrow to learn about
rigging. I think today is the longest I've ever gotten to work on NS (~5 hours)
and it felt great.
