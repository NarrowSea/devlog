Today I finished the third Unity tutorial of this series. Two more to go, so at
the rate that I've been going I should be done by 2022-02-13 or 14.

My focus has been really only on getting these tutorials done quickly but not so
quickly that I fail to learn things. I think I've kept a reasonable pace and I'm
looking forward to getting back to FindTheOwl. Calling it quits 30m earlier is
definitely great for sleep but those 30 minutes are sorely missed in terms of
productivity.

We got Oliver a special clock that turns wakes up when it's time to get up and
goes to sleep when it's time for bed. Also some of those glow in the dark stars.
Hoping that together they help him find a better sleep schedule since lately he's
been waking up sort of randomly in the morning which doesn't help my sleep
schedule. Maintaining sleep hygiene appears to be an important factor for side
project development.
