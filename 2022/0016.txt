More blender tutorials today. Finished up the (tutorial) character design and
have moved on to doing the unwrapping process. The 3d model creation process of
this video was a bit more in depth than the previous tutorial I did. And the
larger focus of this series as being explicitly for a video game brings some
additional insight about some things to think about while molding the character.

The molding process seems like it could be a pit of time. Delicately molding
each individual feather of the owl for months. Unless NS can ever afford a real
art team that is a trap I need to avoid. The art needs to be compelling and
beautiful, but it also needs to be done quickly. That certainly limits the range
of art styles I can go with but that's probably a blessing.

What I'm really saying is that NS won't be doing any realism any time soon. Low
poly, pixel, clayish, etc. will have to be my go to.
