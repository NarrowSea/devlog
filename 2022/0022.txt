No devlog yesterday because I had a video chat for one of my other commitments.

Today we finished the bone structure (as far as I can tell) and are ready to
start animating the character. I've never animated anything so this is going to
be a huge learning experience for me.

Oliver is still a little bit sick but on the mend. I don't think there will be
any more deviations from doing NS work this week so I'm doing my best to catch
up on the 3 missed days this week. Still planning on deferring the scope
re-evaluation until the end of this week. Perhaps a regular re-eval at the end
of the fourth week makes sense for all work cycles. It's enough time to know
whether or not all of the goals are likely to be achieved but also provides
enough buffer on the other end for other people to adjust their expectations.
