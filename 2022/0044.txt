We've refined the Win32 layer quite a bit at this point, so I expect that we
will move on to the actual game development pretty soon.

The process hasn't been nearly as daunting as I thought before (even factoring
in the complexities of the audio buffering layer). Which is great! It doesn't
feel out of my reach to get this.

At some point in the near-ish future I'll need to take a hiatus from Narrow Sea
to knit a new blanket for my soon-to-be-born daughter. There is an upcoming
episode regarding game design as a general topic and that's probably a good
place to park.
