Today was a lot of admin work: looks like TD will be the official bank for NS.
Great!

I'm meeting up with friends tonight so I won't have much more time for playing
with the Owl today. I'm at the point (or close to it) for adding the texture to
the owl and I'd like to go with the clay d'oh generator. I have a feeling that
I'm going to get a lot of use out of that. I'm sort of waiting for the corporate
credit card for that, though.
