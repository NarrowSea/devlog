Finished off the tutorial I've been working on today through Oliver's nap and
this evening session. Really happy with it in general, though we'll see how much
of it and the previous Unity tutorial will stick with me.

Looking at the scope sheet for cycle 1 I'm thinking the best course of action
for now is to focus entirely on the owls and worry about the soundtrack and
player testing in the next work cycle.

That's a fairly severe cut to the scope but from what I've seen so far it
doesn't feel unreasonably severe. I hadn't anticipated the "get each layer
right before moving on to the next step" aspect of 3D modeling but it prevents
me from getting too much of a complete end to end product in a quick cycle.

I'm aware that for future projects focusing on the fun that it will pay back to
go for a rough edges art just to ensure that the actual concept is fun. But for
now I'm maintaining my resolve not to worry about the fun of this first game:
just get everything else in and done (and done well!).

I may come to regret this course of action even for this game, to be honest.
Higher level management and organization principles for game development are
also part of the learning curve!
