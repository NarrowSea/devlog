Continue work on handmade hero. I forgot to mention yesterday that I'm also
trying out doing development on an ergodox split keyboard which is a bit of a
trip.

The lessons today are more about creating the Windows specific layer for the
game. Happy to hear that there are plans in the future to also support other
platforms, and that there isn't any dependencies used (so I get a complete and
visceral experience for the development).
