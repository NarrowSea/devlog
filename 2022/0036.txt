Today I set up a bit of a workflow to get the unity game streaming to my android
phone. It's not ideal since I mostly want to be developing for Oliver on his
iPad but it's probably good enough to get going for now. At the end of the day
I don't think that I'm needing anything particularly advanced from the operating
systems of the mobile devices -- access to the touch interface should be plenty.

I think the first arcade game to build is the drawing application. The really
nice part of that one is that there is no need for any 3d art (or for v1 even
line art). I should be able to release the entire game with just the basic
drawing application. Great!
