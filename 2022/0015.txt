Got a lot of art done today. Started up a new blender tutorial about 3d rigging
characters in blender for use in Unity which is exactly what I need. At the same
time I did some digital work on the next iteration of the owl.

The basic process seems to be:

1. Get a decent 2d reference from a few angles
2. Model around the reference in blender, possibly add some texture maps
3. Add skeleton
4. Final touches in Unity

I'm hoping this tutorial will show me more about the exact transitions between
blender and Unity since they aren't completely compatible. Obviously the end
result is a video game, not a render, so the final touches will need to be in
Unity. At the same time, the blender world is a lot more powerful at creating
the assets so we want to stay in it for as long as possible.

This tutorial is 9 hours long (!) so I'll probably finish it by Thursday which
will leave Friday-Sunday for rigging the owl in FindTheOwl. Again that's a
pretty tight deadline, but hopefully next weekend can be as productive as this
weekend was.
