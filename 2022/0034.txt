Spent the evening helping out with some spring cleaning. There really wasn't
a big reason for me to push too hard on the last day of this work cycle so I
figured that I may as well help out.

I suspect that most of my days during this off cycle will end up being spent on
spring cleaning, but that's really beneficial to all aspects of my life. We are
doing our best to create nicer work areas throughout the house. We've been
carrying some extra stuff with us for far too long and it feels good to finally
go through it all.
