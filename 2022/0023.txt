Animation day! And what fun animation is. After all the work of creating the 3d
character, animation and breathing life into the character is so rewarding. In
a different life I could see myself doing this kind of work all the time.

At the same time, I'm looking forward to moving on to the animation and
development of the owl (as opposed to the tutorial character). I think that the
placement of the bones and armature are really crucial for the animation step to
feel rewarding instead of frustrating. 3d work continues to feel like it will
be best done by completing the entirety of each step before moving on to the
next step. Maybe that's natural for some but it's basically the opposite of what
I'm used to in software delivery: get the entire system working even if each
part needs work before cycling through each component and improving.
