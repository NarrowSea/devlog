In the last few days we finished up work on the basics of game pad / keyboard
input as well as some basic win32 incantations for audio. I don't have much to
say on a day-to-day devlog other than "did more tutorial stuff". Quick 
summaries will have to suffice.

On a higher level, I really love being in complete control of the entire
system. I'm not sure I want to go back to the available engine options despite
the productivity increases they offer. I think that route may also banish NS
into the realm of eternal indie shop... But I'm totally fine with that.
