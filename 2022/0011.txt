More Unity tutorials. Nearly done the third unit which includes a lot of info
about animation and sound in Unity. Those will both be needed in this work cycle
so I'm happy to be working through it.

Some days are a bit harder than others for maintaining drive to get started. The
whole house has been having a bit of a rough patch in our sleep schedules which
is probably the root cause. Today I'm ending the session about 30m earlier than
I have been in an attempt to get a better sleep cycle during the work cycle.

I don't subscribe to the idea that pushing myself beyond the point of exhaustion
leads to better results. I've experienced the productivity gains that you get in
the short run from such tactics but the period of burnout after normally leads
to a net negative effect on overall productivity. That loss of productivity can
perhaps be justified when used to meet the final deadline of a project where you
expect to take a long vacation anyway, but to set it as the norm is damaging.
