Continued work on the skeletal structure today. Again no devlog last night
because I had a sleepover with Oli (still not feeling great). Made me think
about what to do in the case of the unexpected during a work cycle. When it's
just me, there aren't many options at my disposal. Unless I get a day at some
point to try to gain back lost time I likely won't hit all of the cycles goals.

At the same time, I don't want to start lowering the bar for the cycles in general.

I believe the 39 Signals answer to this predicament is that it's okay (but not
great) to lower the deliverables _of this session_ but never okay to lengthen
the session to try to fit all of the deliverables in. I'll see where I'm at by
next Sunday and go from there on perhaps reducing the scope if I don't get an
opportunity to catch up and it isn't looking likely that I'll succeed.
