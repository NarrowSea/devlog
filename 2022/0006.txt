Testing out Unity today. I've actually been able to render a clay-like owl in it
already which is a real improvement over what I'd been able to do thus far in
Godot. I'm not sure if it's a limitation in Godot or a limitation with me but
it's helpful to have so many more tutorials available for Unity.

Not much else to report today. Productivity overall feels low but I'm hoping it's
an investment for future productivity once I figure out how the pipelines work.

This whole clay business is taking too long so I think that tomorrow I'm going
to get back to actually designing the game play of the owls with what I've got
thus far. I can polish and tweak the character later on.
