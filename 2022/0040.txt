Today's lesson dove into how hardware and data is stored and shuffled around on
the hardware. It's quite the lesson! I feel that I'm getting a fairly practical
lesson on a lot of the fundamentals of how the machine works.

doing this even more than anything else that I've tried so far at Narrow Sea.
