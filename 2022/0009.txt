Today I finished the first part of the new Unity tutorial that I'm following. It
has been significantly more valuable! (See poor quality and barely functional
flying clay owl video).

There are another 3 parts to the series and although I'm mostly feeling good
about "how things work" in Unity I think I'm going to go through the entire
thing. The instructor has had a few really good tips that I'm not sure I'd ever
really find out on my own that will save some time (customizing the layout,
forge style wasd control in the main editing view, customizing the play mode
screen tint). I suspect that there will be more features of that type forthcoming.

I need to start thinking about exactly how I want FindTheOwl to play because I'm
quickly approaching the point where I'll be able to actually incorporate play
elements into the game. I have a few ideas:

* Huge open world where finding the owl can take a while and it's mostly about
  the atmosphere and the journey of finding the owl

* Compact world spheres where there would be more of a puzzle element to finding
  the owl somehow

* Total shift in direction where you platform your way to the owl like the
  original Death's Door inspiration

I'll talk with E&A about it tomorrow and see if they have any other thoughts and
ideas as well.
