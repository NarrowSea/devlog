Finished up all of the animation and on to importing the character into Unity.
I think I've said this before but the best part of this tutorial is the end to
end nature of it.

There were some hiccups in my export process that I've had to resolve on my own
but so far they've all been surmountable. The process between the two systems
is not perfect but I'll get used to it. I also suspect that I could use the
extensibility of each system to make the pipeline better, but that could be a
lot of work!

Creating the tooling around game development is an interesting aspect that I
hadn't really considered at the outset of NS. But it's something that we may
end up doing quite a bit of since the frequency of many of the actions is so
high.

I probably won't be working on this again tonight since one of my friends is
having a go away party.
