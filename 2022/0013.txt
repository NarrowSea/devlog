Half-way through lesson 4 of the Unity tutorial series. Today they introduced
Coroutines which will be a great resource. Even the mechanics of the game play 
at this point of the tutorial are getting fun: avoiding the enemy ball in this
tutorial game is engaging.

In a broader sense, I think that this game has given me a direct experience with
the importance of finding the fun early. When I get back to FindTheOwl I think
that figuring out the right feel for the flying should be a top priority. The
music and art can suffer a touch if the game play of the owl feels really good.
