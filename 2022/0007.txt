Unity is quite the system to get used to. I can tell that there is a lot of power
to it but it's also hard to figure where exactly to start. I ran through a couple
of tutorials on editor basics but I'm not sure I got anything out of them. They
were a weird blend of way to basic and also not basic enough.

All hope is not lost, though! I did find another tutorial series that seems more
up my alley. The problem I had with the tutorials I ran today is that it was all
configuring nodes that already existed etc. What I currently want to learn is how
Unity goes about structuring code, connecting input devices, script scoping, etc.

Here's hoping the next tutorial series goes a little bit more smoothly.
