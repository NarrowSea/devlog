Finished part 2 of the 5 part Unity tutorial series that I'm working through.
I'm glad that I decided to keep going -- the sections about how to program are
a bit slow going but it's nice to know where to put all the scripts and how the
various non-code portions of the application work.

Yesterday I was musing about what gameplay we want to achieve in FindTheOwl and,
while I still think it's important that we do our best to make it fun, I also
need to be vigilant against my tendencies to chase rabbits instead of doing the
hard work.

For example, the hard work of composing the music and making the art pieces. I
need to keep focused on bringing together the entire game before worrying about
the Fun of it because the goal of this cycle (and this box) is about learning
all the parts of the process of generating games. Finding the fun is certainly
crucial for our existence as a company but it can come after making prototypes
becomes second nature.

In other words, it's hard to know whether or not a concept will be fun until you
play with it. And without developing skills in making quick prototypes, I'll
only be guessing at Fun. NS can't be guessing about it's main deliverable!

On the other hand, I can't just endlessly get better and better at making
prototypes without ever finishing games (and by that I mean Fun games). So there
is a balancing act. C'est la vie, and it's what the Boxes and the Cycles are for:
during the work cycle, focus on the work that you set out to do. During the play
cycle, take some solitude to determine where the next work cycle would best be
focused.

If it weren't for my stated goals in work cycle 1 I'm sure that I'd be
entertaining the distractions.
