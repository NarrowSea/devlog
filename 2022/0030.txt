So I restarted the owl modeling. And I like it a lot better already. It feels a
lot less shitty-realistic and a lot more fantastical. I'm able to pivot the leg
around the ball joint and the foot around the heel joint really well. So I'm
really happy to have restarted it.

I don't have much else to say today: just modeling a bunch. Hoping to finish the
leg and move on to the wings tomorrow.

On the business side, I've been looking at a few banks to start an account for
NS. I'd like to start using a corporate card for some of the expenses I've been
accumulating and to make it easier to file taxes next year. Fairly mundane stuff.
