Spent the night watching youtube videos about gaming which is a bit lame but I'm
honestly feeling a bit burnt out from my day job work last week. I don't want to
beat myself up about that too much.

As more of a programming note, the first work cycle ends tomorrow night. I'll
maybe be able to get a little bit more done on the current owl (maybe add a
face) but this is basically it for the cycle. I'm not sure what I'm going to
work on during this off cycle but I am sure it won't be 3D modeling. The only
real goal for the off cycle is to decide what to work on during the next work
cycle, and at this junction I need to question whether or not FindTheOwl makes
sense.

Oliver loves playing these mini games on one of the apps on his iPad. The issue
I have is that the games are constantly trying to sell him on other apps and
that sort of thing. The games are also really laggy despite being fairly
simplistic which frustrates him a lot. So I'm thinking of possibly shifting
gears and working on something for him there since it would directly improve
his life.
