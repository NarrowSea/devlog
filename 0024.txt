More animation today. I'm amazed at how much believability you can achieve in
animation with a dearth of keyframes, and amazed also at how much higher you
can raise the bar by adding in small detail keyframes. The animation aspect of
the 3d feels like it rewards obsession but does not necessitate it. That's
perfect for the studio: until I can afford to have someone obsess over the
little keyframes, we can get by well enough by animating a couple of primary
keyframes.

When it comes to FindTheOwl I'll need to start thinking about how much of the
owl I want to be animated vs moved around. For instance, during a left or right
bound glide it would be possible to either animate the wings separately or just
apply a rotation to the owl, or both. I don't think we are looking for a
science based owl simulation here so I'll probably stick with the easy routes
for most things whenever possible.

There's about 2 more hours left in this course so I should have it completed by
Sunday and in time to do my 4 week scope evaluation.
