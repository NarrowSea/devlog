Finished up that huge project at work (or, at least, finished the night and
weekend development aspects of it!). I had a wrap up review meeting this morning,
but otherwise I've been cleared to take some time off. In other words I spent a
good 4 hours or so today modeling the owl. Modeling is really quite tricky!

So long as no other night/weekend project gets assigned to me at work I think
it's still reasonable for me to have the owl mostly ready by the end of this
cycle. It's hard to tell since I'm still so new to blender and doing 3d work. At
the very least I'd like to have an acceptable 3d model done, and I think that
that is doable.
