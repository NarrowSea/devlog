Hi again! The last week was mostly spent playing Heaven's Vault in the evenings.
We're back now for the start of work cycle 2 and I've decided to work on the
playhouse game for Oliver.

I'm a bit unfocused today but I've spent a little bit of time working on a 3d
character named Leti (the Yeti) just to get back in the habit.
