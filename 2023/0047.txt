I've continued my work on Computer, Enhance! and Wirefarer continuously since my last post. I think I'll also jump back into HH as well as SICP after an upcoming family trip we are doing this month.

One thing that I've been playing with lately is Github's Copilot which has been shockingly good? I don't know why it's shocking but I think it's a tool I'd have a hard time going without (like the first time I used an IDE with autocomplete). It's a bit like having a second person that I'm talking to while I'm coding. I was especially impressed with it's knowledge of specific protocols (like Modbus).

In the Computer, Enhance! world we are pretty much done with our 8086 simulator and ready to move on to whatever is next. A strange aside: I've been reading The Dream Machine (Waldrop) and there is some overlap with what we've been up to in Computer, Enhance!. I think that every time I read a book I find these kinds of weird connections to whatever I'm doing in my life. I wonder if there's a word for that?
