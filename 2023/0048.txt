Lately I've been working on Wirefarer mostly, but today I switched back to working on Seafarer (now Cheprove) to help folks with the annoying issue of remotely signing cheques. This is an application that we've used a lot at Abra and that I think might be useful for other people.

I don't think I'll go so far as to make it production ready, but I will use it as an opportunity to play with some new pieces of tech that I haven't used yet:

* Tailwind CSS
* Next.js
* Prisma

The goal is to have it wrapped up as a single deployment docker file. If it's easy enough to launch it could be a great starting point for doing more of these kinds of applications in the XUpSoft studio.
