More bones, now with weight mapping and the start of the more intricate rigging
aspects. Wowee I never realized how many bone and armature components were 
required for doing reasonable animations. Spoiler, it's a lot!

I'm already thinking ahead to how much or little rigging I'll need in the owl.
Definitely the key component are the wings, but if there is going to be any
perching or landing animations then the armature of the talons will be really
important too.

Luckily there won't be a need to animate eyes since owls have immobile eyes. I
just learned that today and it makes that part nice and easy: for an owl to look
at something it must turn its head.

Based on the rigging that we've done so far in the tutorial I'm not sure how
related 3D armature and real life skeletons really are. There's some aspects
that are similar, but designing the foot roll bones for the tutorial character
has taken us way off what a normal foot looks like. For starters I'm fairly
certain that my knee bones are all in my body but honestly I'm not a doctor.

Getting the bone and armature down should be amenable to a good-enough followed
by a polish cycle, especially since it's at the end of the process. I'm not so
sure about the rest of the modeling. There is something about the UV unwrap and
bake process that seems like a harder checkpoint to go back to. Like don't bother
making a great armature on a shitty 3D model because when you make the model good
you'll need to redo the armature anyways. I'm not 100% sure of that but that's
the sense I get right now.
