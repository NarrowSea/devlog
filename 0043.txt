Audio! Today we were able to blow out our ears by playing a square wave way too
loud into the headset. Good times. I think the general Win32 layer is coming
together very well and we'll probably be moving on to some game code soon.

Peeking at the actual schedule...we are still about 18 tutorial days away
(though that time does include making our i/o layers platform independent). All
important stuff!
