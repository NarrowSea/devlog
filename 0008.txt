Today I started another Unity tutorial that is much more promising. It actually
has us in the code editor which is definitely where I feel at home. I've never
used C# before but I'm not too concerned. Especially for this first game, I have
a feeling all the fiddly abstraction layers will be handled by Unity (if not,
what's the point?).

I'm using Rider right out of the gate because I've been enjoying the JetBrains
line throughout the whole last year (just started my second year of subscription).
It already works great! You can control features in Unity from Rider and the
overall integration just feels really well done and not at all like I'm using
a second rate tool.

On a personal note, I finally got around to reorganizing my desk space. I'm super
happy with it: all of my programming books are easily accessible and it just feels
like a great place do get a lot of development done (at both Narrow Sea and at my
current day job -- everybody wins).
