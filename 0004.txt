Today I finished the blender course that I started yesterday. Got a neat clay
owl rendering out of it! I think that I'm doing decent with understanding how
blender works so the next step is probably to do a series about adding a skeleton
to the model and animating it for the game.

Rendering is slow! Wowee.

Overall I'm feeling super encouraged by the straightforwardness of the "box
modeling" that I learned today. 3D creation no longer feels completely out of
touch for me and that's a really nice feeling since everything in this game is
3D.

Time to also start sketching out the owl hero. Step one of this sculpting process
was brining in some front and side views so I'll need to do something similar
going forward.
