I have an okayish owl! You can really tell that I'm new to 3D animation but I'm
mostly happy with it. I was hoping that the wings would be okay to be big slabs
but looking at the results so far I think that I will need to add some feather
elements. The owl just doesn't feel right, especially around the outer part of
the wing.

Part of me is wondering whether or not I should go back to a simpler style. I
know this sounds a big like a joke when looking at the screen shot, but this
owl is maybe too photo realistic. I mean that it's trying to hard to look like
a real owl, but I don't have the talent to actually achieve that so I wind up
in a bad art zone.

It's about 50/50 right now whether or not I trash this design.

From an abstract standpoint, it's really important to not feel bad about 
trashing your designs. Each iteration will make the next one better. As Paul
Graham says in #0038: "Good design is redesign. It takes confidence to throw
work away. You have to be able to think, `there's more where that came from`".
I believe that I have barely broken the earth on my art style and skills.
