Long time no talk! I've been working on the basement a bunch then had a couple
of weeks off for a destination wedding and work trip.

The time off has given me a lot of space to consider what I'd like to get out
of these nightly sessions outside of a business perspective. One of my personal
simmering frustrations with the game engine route is that I don't feel that I'm
making much progress towards understanding how games really work. Instead I get
the feeling that I'm mostly learning the provided tools.

I'm not sure yet what the business implications of going one way or the other
would be. I know that learning game dev "from scratch" will take a much longer
time! On the other hand, it will provide me with much better tools for
appreciating all aspects of game development and, I think, deeper personal
satisfaction for me. I also suspect that many of the lower level thought
patterns will benefit my work at my day job which is a nice bonus!

All of this is to say that my next box and work cycle will be dedicated to the
lower level world of game dev, specifically Handmade Hero by Casey Muratori. A
historical part is that Handmade Hero is the first official purchase made by NS.

Today's focus is on setting up a windows c++ environment.
