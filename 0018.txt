No dev log yesterday because we had to take Oliver to the hospital. He's fine,
just some tummy trouble that the health-line nurse wanted us to get checked out.

Today is back to blender for some actual bone rigging. Again it's been super
helpful to learn in this series which aspects of the character creation belong
in blender vs in Unity. Also learned a bit more about baking normal maps which
will be heavily used if I end up going down the clay route with FindTheOwl.

Creating the bone structures is a lot of fun! After all of the work of sculpting
out the character it feels a bit like a victory lap around blender. We'll see
if I still feel that way at the end, though.

Some projects at my main job are coming due soon and I may get assigned to work
this weekend which will cut into cycle 1 quite a bit. That's okay though; the
day job takes priority. Maybe I'll write more on my perspectives and thoughts
about juggling multiple projects and family life, but for now suffice it to say
that working on NS is a privilege that I'm enjoying only because I don't let it
negatively impact any of my main commitments (as an employee or as a 
Father/Husband).
