Frustrations! I'm enamored by the clay style owl from yesterday but achieving
a similar effect in Godot is...very challenging. Why am I still bothering? The
time pressure of cycle 1 is making me reconsider not using one of the paid game
engine systems, especially while I'm still so new at everything.

I don't know enough about game engines to know where Godot is lacking versus one
of the primary options or how (if) I would go about improving it.

As Jesse said to me the other day ... "are you making games or are you building
a game engine?"

If time were infinite I'd like the answer to be both at once. But I think that
it will be challenge enough to be financially secure with game dev as it is with
all of the best tools at my disposal. Right now my headspace is to go with the
standard big tools and possibly loop back to basics when I'm more experienced.

I'll sleep on it, but why waste any more of my 6 weeks fighting when I should be
*creating?*
