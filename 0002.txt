Today is the first day of the first 6 week cycle. I really pumped up my goals
for this period. Inspired primarily by Mark Brown at Game Maker's Toolkit. This
week I'll be looking into controlling the owl and flying around in Godot.

I'm not currently worried about having it be too pretty, but I don't want to put
off the art and sound forever, either. I'd at least like to articulate the motion
of the flap in a reasonable time frame. This of course implies the development
of the primary art style of the game which has me slightly concerned since I
haven't done enough art to even purposefully go for a particular style.

I'm more confident in bringing in a bit of background music and effects, but
only after eating the frogs of control and animation.
