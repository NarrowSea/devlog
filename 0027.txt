I've been completely swamped with work at my day job during the last couple of
nights. Might be working the weekend too. If so, hopefully I can get a few days
off afterwards to catch up on NS and/or just lower the burnout levels a bit.

I got moved to a project which has a hard deadline of next Wednesday so it's a
bit of a scramble to get that up and running. It's hard to manage side projects
in a work cycle fashion when the long work days hit but c'est la vie. I'm fairly
fortunate that these kinds of sprints aren't too regular.

I'll try to do some devlogs anyways but no promises. Sometimes after a full day
and night of working at the day job I just need to go straight to bed to recover
for the next day.
