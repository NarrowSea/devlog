More blender tutorial work. The character is now fully unwrapped and we have
moved on to texture painting. The feeling of drawing on the computer is rusty
for me but that's okay -- to reiterate my feelings from yesterday, there is no
need to create photo realism here.

A lot of the depth of character for the owl will come from layering the feather
zones of the wings and body in nice ways. I'm currently hoping to do that with
actual 3d objects rather than via texture paint. Not that I won't do any texture
painting at all, but I'd like for the effects of the texture painting to be both
broad (large color blocks) and for subtleties (hinting at more feathers than
there are in the 3d model).

I keenly feel that the art is my biggest weakness in this entire endeavour. Not
a surprise, really. I have a lot of catching up to do -- maybe to the point
where the first play cycle should be focused directly on the more foundational
aspects of art. We'll see!
